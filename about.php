		<h3>About this Project</h3>

		EpiMAP is a revolutionary new global health solution to understand and predict the spread of infectious disease. EpiMAP uses advanced analytics and data mining from social media feeds to display dynamic information in a geographical information system. This health revolution has been facilitated by the increasing accessibility of social media in developing countries and the ability to analyse large data sets. EpiMAP is unique in its ability to show live feeds of worldwide data and has uses in academia and govermental infection control. EpiMAP targets three of the most prevalent infectious diseases:
<br /><br />
1) HIV/AIDs - On a global scale, men make up a slim majority of the 33.2 million people living with HIV. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, which has about 22 million people living with HIV, women and girls account for about 61% of adults living with the disease. In the Caribbean, the figure hovers around 50%. The number of women living with HIV continues to increase in Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
<br /><br />
2) Cholera - Cholera is a disease spread mostly through contaminated drinking water and unsanitary conditions. It is endemic in the Indian subcontinent, Russia, and sub-Saharan Africa. It is an acute infection of the intestines with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Its main symptom is copious diarrhea. Between 5% and 10% of those infected with the disease will develop severe symptoms, which also include vomiting and leg cramps. In its severe form, cholera can cause death by dehydration. An estimated 200,000 cases are reported to WHO annually
<br /><br />
3) Influenza - Several influenza epidemics in the 20th century caused millions of deaths worldwide, including the worst epidemic in American history, the Spanish influenza outbreak that killed more than 500,000 in 1918. Today influenza is less of a public health threat, though it continues to be a serious disease that affects many people. Approximately 20,000 people die of the flu in the United States every year. The influenza virus attacks the human respiratory tract, causing symptoms such as fever, headaches, fatigue, coughing, sore throat, nasal congestion, and body aches.
